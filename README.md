# Box_Office_Analysis

Overview

In this data analysis project, I conducted an in-depth examination of the movie industry using a comprehensive dataset. The project involved analyzing various factors influencing a movie's success, including budget, genre, and runtime. Key findings and summarizations included the expansion of movie choices for audiences, the absence of a direct budget-popularity relationship, and recommendations for creating more popular films based on runtime and preferred genres.

Key Achievements:

Performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover meaningful insights from a large movie dataset.
Utilized statistical analysis to draw conclusions and make data-driven recommendations for optimizing movie production.
Created compelling data visualizations and reports to communicate findings effectively.
